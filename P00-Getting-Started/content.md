This is the sixth and final tutorial of Make School's full-stack web series! In this tutorial, we'll build our first full-stack, MVC web app

# What's a Web App?

In an earlier tutorial, we learned what a _web page_ is. A bunch of web pages together make up a _web site_. For example, the web site for a small restaurant might have a landing page, a menu page, and a 'Contact Us' page–all together, that's their website.

A _web app_ is the next step up from a web site. Like a web site, it's made of many web pages, but unlike a simple web site, a web app is backed by a server that can perform complex tasks, and probably a database. Google and Facebook are examples of web apps. The most distinguishing feature of web apps is that their web pages are _dynamically_ generated (as opposed to static HTML).  When you open your Facebook Feed and see a bunch of posts, there's not a person sitting somewhere typing up all of the HTML–it's made of templates that are filled in and combined to make web pages.

# What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- set up and configure an Express web server
- use Mongoose and MongoDB to store information in a database
- set up a username/password authentication system
- learn about the MVC architecture for organizing your code
- learn about the REST style of organizing your URLs

# If You Get Stuck

Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, pause for a moment and take a breath. Maybe take a walk. Then retrace your steps (in the tutorial, not the walk.) Make sure you've followed each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or accidentally skip over important steps.
