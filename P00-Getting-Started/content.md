By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- learn about the REST style of organizing your URLs

# If You Get Stuck

Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, pause for a moment and take a breath. Maybe take a walk. Then retrace your steps (in the tutorial, not the walk.) Make sure you've followed each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or accidentally skip over important steps.

If you want to compare your code to the solution, you can find it here:
