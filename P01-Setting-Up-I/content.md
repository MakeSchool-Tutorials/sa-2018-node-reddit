We're going to learn how to set up a web server using Express, generate HTML using Handlebars, and make it look good using Sass.

Before we dive in, it's helpful to think about the big picture and understand how these tools work together.  We're going to build our app using an architecture called Model-View-Controller (MVC).

# Web Applications
<!-- TODO: explain web applications in webpage-web server-database diagram, so that I can project MVC onto it -->

# MVC

Under the MVC architecture, we think of our app as having three main systems that work together:

<!-- TODO: MVC diagram -->

  - The View is the part of our app the user sees and clicks on. In a web app, this is usually our HTML pages.
  - The Model is the part where we store information and define behavior for all of the objects in our database. For example, when a user registers a new account on our app, the Model is responsible for storing their name, email address and password in the database.
  - The Controller is the part in between–the code that gets information from the Models and sends it to the Views, and takes information from the Views and gives it to the Models. The Views and Models rarely communicate directly; the Controller manages their interactions.

In this tutorial, almost all of the code we write will belong to one of these three domains. In this part, we won't work with Models very much–we need a database for that, and that happens in Part 2. We will get a good introduction to Views, and a brief introduction to Controllers (which are called "Routers" in Express).

# Express

[Explain what a web server is] At its most basic, a web server is a machine that receives an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response. (We'll learn more about HTTP in Part 4.) What happens in between receiving the request and sending the response can be dead simple or insanely complicated–it all depends on the situation. A very simple web server might only return static HTML files that you write yourself. In this case, Node.js is good enough to develop your web server because its built-in tools are sufficient for simply returning files. But as we start to add more complex functions, like writing to a database, logging users in and out, writing posts, etc..., we'll need some more powerful tools...

Enter [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It is by far the most popular web framework in the Node ecosystem, and it's going to provide us with a lot of the basic functions we need to develop our app. For example: setting up dynamically-rendered HTML templates (we're going to make our HTML write itself!); organizing all of the URLs users can visit to see different pages; providing helper methods to set up and connect to databases; create error messages; and so much more...

## Express Generator

Express is "unopinionated", which means we can organize the files in our code however we want. Express has very few requirements in terms of what our files and directories are called, or how they work together; it doesn't matter how many files we have, or even how they work together. Some structure can be helpful for getting started.  There are lots of apps and packages to help you start a new project (see examples in the "Further Reading" section at the bottom of this page.) For this tutorial, we're going to use the Express team's recommended tool, [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)

The following instructions assume you already have Node and NPM installed on your computer. Open your terminal and enter:
<!-- TODO: where should I direct students who might not have Node/NPM installed? Do we have an environment set up tutorial? -->

```
npm install express-generator -g
```

The `-g` option tells NPM to install the package globally.

After it's installed, enter:

```
express --view=hbs --css=sass makereddit
```

The `--view=hbs` option means that we want to use a package called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for our views and one called [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for our CSS.  We'll learn more about these in the section below. Express Generator has a ton of options–to see for yourself, enter `express -h`.

When it's finished, you'll see the following instructions:

```
install dependencies:
     $ cd makereddit && npm install
```

Enter `cd makereddit && npm install` to change directories and install dependencies.

## Directory Structure and Important Files

Now we have a template for a basic MVC web app. Open the `makereddit` folder in your favorite text editor, and let's have a look at what's there...

![file tree](assets/file_tree.png)

 Our Models, Views and Controllers will all live in this directory. The `views/` folder is there already. Our Controllers are there too, but Express-Generator calls them 'Routes', and they live in the `routes/` folder. Our Models don't have a place here yet, but soon we'll add another folder for them called `models/`.

 Everything else is mostly configuration, dependencies, and auto-generated system files. A couple of particularly important files: `package.json` is where we keep basic, low-level configuration options like the name of our app, the version, and most importantly, our dependencies. `app.js` holds setup and configuration related to Express and, later, our database. Take a minute to look through these files–don't expect to understand everything in them, but start to get familiar with what these files look like.

## Hello World

Let's open the `views/index.hbs` file.  Soon we'll learn more about what an `.hbs` file is and how it works, but for right now it's enough to understand that this is our "home page".  This is the file that renders when people first visit our website.

Let's change `Welcome to {{title}}` to `Hello, world`, so that our file looks like this:

```HTML
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<p>Hello, world</p>
```
<!-- [TODO: comment on why 'hello world'] -->

Now, start the server by entering `npm start` into your terminal, then open your web browser and go to `localhost:3000`.  You should see something like this:

![hello world](assets/hello_world.png)

Congratulations! You just built a web app! We've still got some work to do before it does anything useful, but we've taken our first big step.

## Nodemon

Let's add one more useful tool before we move on. Let me demonstrate a small problem:  

We just want our website to say "hello, world" so we know it's working, but the biggest letters on the page actually say "Express".  If we look back at our code in `views/index.hbs` it seems to be coming from the `<h1>{{title}}</h1>`. But what are those curly braces for? And how does it know `title` is supposed to be "Express"?

This feature comes from Handlebars (which is why these files end with `.hbs`).  We'll learn about Handlebars in more detail in the next section, but for now let's just make that `title` be "Hello, world", instead of "Express".

First, open `/routes/index.js`. Lines 5-7 should look like this:

```Javascript
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});
```

We're going to learn all about routes in parts 3 and 4, so don't worry if this still seems mysterious–soon, it won't. This just tells our web server that when anybody visits the root path of our website, or the home page, it should render a file called 'index' (`/views/index.hbs`!), and then it assigns the value `'Express'` to the key `title`.

Let's change that 'title' to 'Hello, world', so that the entire `/routes/index.js` file looks like this:

```Javascript
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Hello, world' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

Now–be sure to save your file!–then, let's go back to the browser and hit refresh.  And:

![hello world](assets/hello_world.png)

:flushed:

Unfortunately, Express only reads these files _when it starts_.  After that, it ignores any changes we make. One quick fix is to simply restart the server:
- Go to the terminal where the server is running
- Hit `control` + `c` on your keyboard. (This is a very common command for stopping command line programs)
- enter `npm start` to restart the server

Now when we refresh the page:

![hello world](assets/hello_world_2.png)

:relieved:

But it's a huge pain if we have to stop and restart the server after every. single. little. change.  Luckily, there are lots of packages that will take care of restarting the server for us. As you grow as a developer, you'll eventually learn about tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).  But for this project, we're going to use a super simple solution called [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) (short for "Node Monitor").

First, open your terminal and enter:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

(the `-g` means we're installing it globally, so it's available anywhere on your system, not just for this project)

Now, instead of typing `npm start`, we'll type `nodemon start`.  Go ahead:  use `control`+`c` to stop the running server, then enter:

```
nodemon start
```

Now in our `routes/index.js` file, let's set the title on our home page to be our real title, "MakeReddit":

```Javascript
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'MakeReddit' });
});
```

Now, **without** restarting the server, let's go to the browser and refresh the page:

![hello world](assets/hello_world_3.png)

:satisfied:

# Handlebars and Sass
<!-- TODO: remove bootstrap references -->

<!-- ## Handlebars -->

<!-- [TODO: no code writing here, just a quick overview of what Handlebars is, what the `{{...}}` tags are, etc...] -->

## Layout File

Remember what we learned about HTML in previous tutorials, and then let's look back at `views/index`:

```HTML
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<p>Hello world</p>
```

what's missing?  This isn't a complete HTML document... Let's open the `views/layout.hbs` file.  At first, it should look like this:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    {{{body}}}
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's everything missing from `views/index.hbs`. This layout file is special because it will load with every page in our app. The contents of `index.hbs` are rendered in place of `{{{body}}}`.

<!-- TODO: elaborate, including example with wireframes would be nice -->

## Adding a Navbar

Let's add a navigation bar that will load at the top of every page in our app. Because we want it on _every_ page, it needs to go in `views/layout.hbs`:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
      <div class="logo">
        MakeReddit
      </div>

      <div>
        log in/log out
      </div>
    </nav>

    <main>
      {{{body}}}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Our navigation bar is everything between the `<nav>...</nav>` tags. We're starting really simple; we just want the name of our app on the top left of every page, and a log in/log out link on the top right. We won't actually _implement_ logging in and out until part 3, so for now there's just some placeholder text, "log in/log out".

The other detail we're adding is wrapping `{{{body}}}` in `<main>...</main>` tags. That's not going to make a big visible change, but it's good practice to use [HTML5 semantic tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

<!-- TODO: primer/review on HTML5 tags -->

<!-- TODO: include wireframe -->

Now, let's check out that new nav bar:

![nav bar](assets/nav_bar_1.png)

That's obviously not great. Let's add some styling.

## Sass (and Scss)

<!-- TODO: better primer on sass -->
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), short for "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", gives us lots of nice options lacking in regular CSS, such as nested rules and variables. But be aware that there are two variants of Sass: `.sass` files and `.scss` files. The only difference is syntax–`.sass` has a distinct syntax, without braces or semicolons, while `.scss` syntax is almost the same as regular `.css`. In fact, a regular CSS file is already valid `.scss`. We want to use `.scss`, but the default is `.sass`. Let's change that.

Open `app.js`, and find the section of code where we configure Sass. It's probably on lines 24 to 27, and it looks like this:

```Javascript
app.use(sassMiddleware({
  src: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
  dest: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
  indentedSyntax: true, // true = .sass and false = .scss
  sourceMap: true
}));
```

We're concerned with the `indentedSyntax` option. By default it's `true`; let's set it to `false`. As the comment says, we want to use `.scss`.

Finally, look in the `public/stylesheets/` directory. There's a file there called `style.sass`. Delete it and create a new file called `style.scss`. Inside, paste the following:

```CSS
body {
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 5rem 3rem 3rem 3rem;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}

nav {
  position: fixed;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;

  height: 4.125em;
  width: 98vw;
  z-index: 999;

  left: 0;
  top: 0;

  background-color: #fff;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 5px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  padding: 0 1em;

  .logo {
    font-size: 1.25em;
  }
}
```

And then let's check out our nav bar at `localhost:3000`:
