title: "Posts, One-to-Many Relationships, Nested Routes"
slug: 05-posts

In this section we will give users the ability to create posts and comment on existing posts.  Along the way we'll also learn a little about nested routes–what they are, how they work, and why you would want them.

# Database Relationships

Objects in our database can be related to each other in different ways. For example, we might have a database of houses where each house has one owner and, for this system, each owner can have only one house–this is a *one-to-one* relationship.  Or, say you're building a music app where users can make playlists. Then, a playlist can have a bunch of different songs on it, and any of those songs could be on any number of other playlists–this is a *many-to-many* relationship.

The relationship we're concerned about here is the one between rooms and posts. Each room has a topic, and users are free to discuss that topic as much as they want, so one room needs to be able to contain multiple posts–this is a *many-to-many* relationship.

# Message Model

First, let's define our Message model so that we can save it to the database.  Just like with Users and Rooms, we'll need to make a file for our model.  In that file, well define a `MessageSchema` that has a subject and a body (both Strings), and references its room.

Try it yourself, then check the solution below.

```Javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
//
const MessageSchema = new Schema({
  subject: String,
  body: String,
  room: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Room' },
});
//
module.exports = mongoose.model('Message', MessageSchema);
```

<!-- # Nested Routes -->

<!-- TODO: include code for nesting posts inside rooms -->

# Post Routes (__not__ POST routes...)

We won't create exactly the same set of options for Posts that we did for Rooms. For one thing, we won't have an `index`, because the Room's `show` action will basically serve that purpose by displaying all of the posts for that room.  And, although they could be useful, we won't create `show` or `edit` actions right now, either. So we're starting with only

For now, let's create a new file called `routes/posts.js` and paste in the following:

```Javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});
const auth = require('./helpers/auth');
const Room = require('../models/room');

// Posts new
router.get('/new', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO
});

// Posts create
router.post('/', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO
})

module.exports = router;
```

# Posts New and Create

First, let's give our users a way to create new posts and save them to our database. This is going to be very similar to the `new` and `create` actions we set up for rooms, but...

<!-- TODO: set up and give code snippets, then ask students to implement -->

<!-- TODO: hide solutions behind fold -->

`views/posts/new.hbs`
```HTML
<div>
  <form action="/rooms/{{room.id}}/posts" method="post">
    <legend>New Post</legend>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="post-title">Subject</label>
      <input type="text" name="subject" class="form-control" id="post-subject" placeholder="Subject">
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="post-title">Body</label>
      <input type="text" name="body" class="form-control" id="post-body" placeholder="Body">
    </div>

    <div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>
```

'routes/posts.js'
```Javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});
const auth = require('./helpers/auth');
const Room = require('../models/room');

router.get('/new', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.roomId, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };

    res.render('posts/new', { room: room });
  });
});

router.post('/', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.roomId, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };

    let post = new Post(req.body);
    post.room = room;

    post.save(function(err, post) {
      if(err) { console.error(err) };

      return res.redirect(`/rooms/${room._id}`);
    });
  });
})

module.exports = router;
```

# Add Posts to Rooms Show View

When we go into a room, we expect to see all of the posts on that topic.  Let's update the Rooms show view so that when we go to a room, we find all of the related posts and render them on the page.

Let's start with the view itself.  Open `views/rooms/show.hbs` and replace the contents with the following:

```HTML
<div>
  <h1>{{room.topic}}</h1>
</div>

<div>
  {{#each posts as |post|}}
    <div class="post-div">
      <h3>{{post.subject}}</h3>
      <p>{{post.body}}</p>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>

<div>
  <a href="/rooms/{{room.id}}/posts/new">New Post</a>
</div>
```

<!-- TODO: walk through code.  esp:, do I need to intro or review #each? New Post link is new, also-->

Let's define `posts` in `routes/rooms.js`.  Update the `show` action to the following:

```Javascript
// Rooms show
router.get('/:id', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.id, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };

    Post.find({ room: room }, function(err, posts) {
      if(err) { console.error(err) };

      res.render('rooms/show', { room: room, posts: posts });
    });
  });
});
```

And let's require our Post model at the top of the file, so that Javascript knows what a `Post` is:

```Javascript
const Post = require('../models/post');
```

<!-- TODO: walk through code -->

Now, let's browse to `localhost:3000/rooms`.  Open any of the rooms you've created, then click on 'New Post'. Add your new post to the database, and you should be redirected to `room/:id`–which should display your post.
