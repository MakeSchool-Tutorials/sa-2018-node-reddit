title: "Messages, Database Relationships, Nested Routes"
slug: 05-messages

In this section we will give users the ability to create posts and comment on existing posts.  Along the way we'll also learn a little about nested routes–what they are, how they work, and why you would want them.

# Database Relationships

Objects in our database can be related to each other in different ways. For example, we might have a database of houses where each house has one owner and (for this system) each owner can have only one house–this is a _one-to-one_ relationship. One owner, one house, that's all.

<!-- TODO: diagram & schema -->

Or, say you're building a music app where users can make playlists. Then, a playlist can have a bunch of different songs on it, and any of those songs could be on any number of other playlists–this is a _many-to-many_ relationship.

<!-- TODO: diagram & schema -->

The relationship we're concerned about here is the one between rooms and posts. Each room has a topic, and users are free to discuss that topic by posting as many messages as they like. So, one room needs to be able to contain multiple posts, and each post belongs to exactly one room–this is a _one-to-many_ relationship.

<!-- TODO: diagram & schema -->

# Message Model

First, let's define our Message model so that we can save it to the database.  Just like with Users and Rooms, we'll need to make a file for our model.  In that file, well define a `MessageSchema` that has a subject and a body (both Strings), and references its room.

Check out `models/room.js` and `models/user.js` to remind yourself of the syntax, then try it yourself. When you're done, check the solution below.

```Javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
//
const MessageSchema = new Schema({
  subject: String,
  body: String,
  room: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Room' },
});
//
module.exports = mongoose.model('Message', MessageSchema);
```

<!-- TODO: include adding code for nesting posts inside rooms -->

# Messages Routes

We won't create exactly the same set of REST actions for Messages that we did for Rooms. For one thing, we won't have an `index`–the Room's `show` action will basically serve that purpose by displaying all of the messages for that room.  And, although they could _possibly_ be useful, we won't create `show` or `edit` actions right now, either. We're starting with only _new_ and _create_.

Let's create a new file called `routes/messages.js` and add in the following:

```Javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});
const auth = require('./helpers/auth');
const Room = require('../models/room');

// Messages new
router.get('/new', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO
});

// Messages create
router.post('/', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO
})

module.exports = router;
```

Of course, we'll fill in these actions over the next few sections.

# Messages New and Create

Let's give our users a way to create new posts and save them in our database through these _new_ and _create_ actions. This is going to be very similar to the _new_ and _create_ actions we set up for rooms, but with one added twist–_nested routes_.

When we set up our Rooms _new_ view in the previous part (`views/rooms/new.hbs`), we didn't have to pass any values from the controller–unlike in our _edit_ view for example (`views/rooms/edit.hbs`), where we have to pass a `room` object from the _controller_ (`routes/rooms.js`). In nested routes, you'll _always_ have to pass a value. Because all of our messages will be associated with a room, we need to know _which_ room when we create a new message. Luckily, our route is `rooms/:roomId/messages/new` (see the section on REST in the previous part of this tutorial), which means we always have the `roomId`.

Your _new_ controller action can access the `roomId` value as `req.params.roomId`, and it will use this to find the correct room by calling `Room.findById()`. Review the Rooms _edit_ controller action (in `routes/rooms.js`) for an example of how to do it.

Try to implement the Messages _new_ and _create_ actions, then make sure your code matches the solutions below:

```HTML
<div>
  <form action="/rooms/{{room.id}}/messages" method="post">
    <legend>New Message</legend>

    </div>
  </form>

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});
const auth = require('./helpers/auth');
const Room = require('../models/room');

router.get('/new', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.roomId, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };

    res.render('messages/new', { room: room });
  });
});
>
router.post('/', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.roomId, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };
>
    let message = new Message(req.body);
    message.room = room;
>
    message.save(function(err, post) {
      if(err) { console.error(err) };
>
      return res.redirect(`/rooms/${room._id}`);
    });
  });
})

module.exports = router;

# Add Posts to Rooms Show View

When we go into a room, we expect to see all of the posts on that topic. Let's update the Rooms show view so that when we go to a room, we find and render all of its related posts on the page.

Let's start with the view itself.  Open `views/rooms/show.hbs` and replace the contents with the following:

# Add Messagess to Rooms Show View

When we go into a room, we expect to see all of the messages posted about that topic.  Let's update the Rooms _show_ view so that when we go to a room, we find all of the related messages and render them on the page. Let's start with the view itself.

  {{#each messages as |message|}}

Here we see another [Handlebars Helper](http://handlebarsjs.com/block_helpers.html) in the form of `#each`. If we have a collection of objects, such as all of the messages that belong in a room, we can create a block of HTML for _each_ one of them. Also notice the `<a>...</a>` tag towards the bottom–it's another example of using nested routes.

Let's define `posts` in `routes/rooms.js`.  Update the `show` action to the following:

Before we can use the `messages` collection in that view, we need to define it in our controller (`routes/rooms.js`).

Require the Message model at the top of the file, so that Javascript knows what a `Message` is, and update the _show_ action to the following:
>
```Javascript
// ...
const Post = require('../models/post');
>
// ...
>
// Rooms show
router.get('/:id', auth.requireLogin, (req, res, next) => {
  Room.findById(req.params.id, function(err, room) {
    if(err) { console.error(err) };
>
    Post.find({ room: room }, function(err, posts) {
      if(err) { console.error(err) };
>
      res.render('rooms/show', { room: room, posts: posts });
    });
  });
});
```

Let's check that it works. Browse to `localhost:3000/rooms`.  Open any of the rooms you've created, then click on 'New Post'. Add your new post to the database, and you should be redirected to `room/:id`–which should display your post.

So far our users can create rooms to discuss topics, and post messages in those rooms–this is starting to look like a real discussion app! But so far,  -->
